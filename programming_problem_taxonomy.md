### **Two Pointers:**

Yes, if all of these conditions are fulfilled:
* **Linear data structure:** The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, such as an array, linked list, or string.
* **Process pairs:** Process data elements at two different positions simultaneously.
* **Dynamic pointer movement:** Both pointers move independently of each other according to certain conditions or criteria. In addition, both pointers might move along the same or two different data structures.

### **Fast and Slow Pointers:**
- **Cycle detection**: Floyd's algorithm, tortoise and hare
- **Keywords**: "cycle", "loop", "middle element", "intersection"

**Does your problem match this pattern?**
Yes, if the following condition is fulfilled:
* **Linear data structure:** The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, such as an array, linked list, or string.

In addition, if either of these conditions is fulfilled:
* **Cycle or intersection detection:** The problem involves detecting a loop within a linked list or an array or involves finding an intersection between two linked lists or arrays.
* **Find the starting element of the second quantile:** This means identifying the element where the second part of a divided dataset begins‚Äîlike the second half, second third (tertile), or second quarter (quartile). For example, the task might ask you to find the middle element of an array or a linked list, which marks the start of the second half.

Yes, if all of these conditions are fulfilled:

* **Processing subsets of elements:** The problem requires repeated computations on a contiguous subset of data elements (a subarray or a substring), such that the window moves across the input array from one end to the other. The size of the window may be fixed or variable, depending on the requirements of the problem.
* **Efficient computation time complexity:** The computations performed every time the window moves take constant or very small time.
